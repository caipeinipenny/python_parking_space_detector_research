# python_parking_space_detector_research

## Overview
The Parking Space Detection project is designed to help monitor parking spaces in real-time using computer vision techniques. This application allows users to define parking spaces on an image, and then processes video input to detect available parking spots. It provides a visual representation of occupied and free parking spaces, making it easier for users to manage parking lots efficiently.

## Features
- **Parking Space Marking**: Users can interactively mark parking spaces in a static image using left and right mouse clicks.
- **Real-time Detection**: The application processes video input to detect whether parking spaces are occupied or free.
- **Visual Feedback**: It visually indicates free spaces in green and occupied spaces in red within the video feed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Instructions are displayed on the video feed to guide users on how to mark and manage parking spaces.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations, which is used for image processing.
- **Pickle**: A module for serializing and deserializing Python object structures, used for saving and loading parking space positions.
